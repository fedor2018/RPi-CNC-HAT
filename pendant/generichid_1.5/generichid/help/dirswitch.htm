<h1>Directional Switch (Hat Switch)</h1>
<p>The directional switch, or hat switch, or switched joystick, is a navigation 
type device that uses switches to specify the direction.&nbsp; They come in 
2-way, 4-way and possibly 8-way (I've never seen one, and probably 
misinterpreted a 4 way which can output 8 values).</p>
<p>A 4-way directional switch, commonly found as hat switches on joysticks and 
game pads, has 4 switches in the North, South, East, West directions.&nbsp; When 
the stick is moved in the North direction, for example, the North switch 
triggers.&nbsp; If the stick is moved in the North East direction, both the 
North and East switches trigger.</p>
<p>A 2-way direction switch is used to specify navigation in either the North 
South direction, or East West.&nbsp; Of course, this can be interpreted as up 
down as a volume control as is required by the application.</p>
<p>The difference between a Directional Switch and a jumble of buttons is the 
way Generic HID interprets the directional switch.&nbsp; The 4-way switch will 
have 9 outputs.&nbsp; -1 for no selection, and the values 0-7 for the directions 
N,NW,W,S,SW,S,SE,E,NE.&nbsp; The application software can then convert these 
values into a directional angle (0-359&deg;). </p>
<p>The directional switch typically uses mechanical switches, so a pull-up 
resistor and debouncing should be used.&nbsp; See
<a href="mechanicalswitches.htm">Mechanical Switches</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>Components can be given an optional name.&nbsp; This is seen in the Test tab.  Not all applications support the name.&nbsp; 
Hidcomp/hidconfig supports names.</p>

<h3 id="Usage">UsagePage/Usage</h3>
<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the Directional Switch.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Directions">Directions</h3>
<p>The number of directions.</p>

<h3 id="Pullup">Pull Up</h3>
<p>Should the internal pullup resistor of the microcontroller be used.  Normally set to true when switching to ground.  See 
<a href="mechanicalswitches.htm">Mechnical Switches</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="DebounceMs">Debounce (ms)</h3>
<p>Waits for the mechanical switch stop bouncing before registering a switch closure.&nbsp; Enter the time to wait in milliseconds.
See 
<a href="mechanicalswitches.htm">Mechnical Switches</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p> Defines the amount of electrical current used by the LED in mA.  This is used to estimate the USB power draw.&nbsp; 
See the section on <a href="power.htm">Power</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Current drawn by switches is usually insignificant and can be set to 0.</p>

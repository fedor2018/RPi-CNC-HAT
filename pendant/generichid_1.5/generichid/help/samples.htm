<h2>CNC Pendant 1</h2>
<p>This is my first CNC pendant, designed for Mach3.&nbsp; It has many 
unnecessary controls, but I added them so I can build and test Generic HID.&nbsp; 
It has both a jog dial and axis joysticks.&nbsp; When I decide which one I like, 
my next pendant will have them.&nbsp; I have also yet to update my mach3 
drivers, so I'm using this with my lathe, <a href="http://www.linuxcnc.org/">
EMC2</a> and <a href="http://www.franksworkshop.com.au/EMC/hidcomp/hidcomp.htm">
hidcomp</a>.</p>

<h2>CNC Pendant 2</h2>
<p>This is the pendant for my CNC Lathe, although there aren't any lathe specific features.&nbsp; It is based around a
<a href="http://www.rose-bopla.com/Prod_Pgs/Handhelds/Prod_04_BG_180_220_Handheld_Series.htm">
Rose-Bopla BG220 Handheld Enclosure</a>.&nbsp; It is a large hand held enclosure 
with a cut out for a display.&nbsp; Unfortunately the cut out and mounting holes 
for the display are an awkward fit.&nbsp; It didn't fit a stock 20x4 LCD.&nbsp; 
A compact one would fit, but would leave a lot of space around the outside.&nbsp; 
So, I found a 3.2&quot; 240x320 RGB graphics LCD that fit nicely when mounted 
sideways.&nbsp; I've built the 
<a href="http://www.franksworkshop.com.au/Electronics/GraphicLCD/GraphicLCD.htm">graphic controller</a> which just does text at the 
moment, and now just need to update GenericHID to support it - it has an SPI 
interface, multiple fonts, and lots of rows and columns.&nbsp; The photo below 
is of the pendant almost complete.&nbsp; A short write up of the completed pendant can be 
found

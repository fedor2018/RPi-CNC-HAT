<h1>Counter</h1>
<p>The counter is a millisecond counter.&nbsp; It simply counts, a multiple of 
1ms, and keeps incrementing a counter.&nbsp; It starts when the device is 
plugged in, and will wrap the counter back to 0 when it overflows.</p>
<p>The counter is a virtual device.&nbsp; It appears as a USB input value.&nbsp; 
It doesn't have wire to wire to a pin.</p>
<p>What is it used for?&nbsp; The counter can be used for a watch dog, updating 
the counter every 500ms, for example.&nbsp; If the application doesn't receive 
an update every 500ms, it knows the Generic HID is on longer accessible.&nbsp; 
This could be useful for CNC pendant controls, that should shut down the system 
if a fault occurs.</p>
<p>It can also be used to time between updates.&nbsp; For example, if the 
counter was set to count every 1ms, it could be used to time the rate of
<a href="digitalencoder.htm">encoder</a> pulses and determine the velocity of 
the dial.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>Components can be given an optional name.&nbsp; This is seen in the Test tab.  Not all applications support the name.&nbsp; 
Hidcomp/hidconfig supports names.</p>

<h3 id="Usage">UsagePage/Usage</h3>
<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the Counter.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Period">Period</h3>
<p>Period of the counter in milliseconds.  Every 'Period' ms, the counter ticks.  
Setting it to 1, causes the counter to count milliseconds.&nbsp; Setting to 
1000, causes it to count in 1 second units.</p>

<h3 id="CounterBits">Counter Bits</h3>
<p>The size of counter variable.  1-16 bits.&nbsp; A 1 bit counter will toggle 
between 0 and 1 every &quot;period&quot; milliseconds.&nbsp; A 16 bit counter will count 
from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 (65535).&nbsp; At a 1ms period, this causes the 
number to wrap after 65.535 seconds.</p>

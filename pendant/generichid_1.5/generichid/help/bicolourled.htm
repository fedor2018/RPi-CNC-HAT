<h1>Bi-Colour LED</h1>
<p>There are two different types of bicolour LEDs.&nbsp; In my terminology, I 
call this one bi-colour, and the other <a href="tricolourled.htm">tri-colour</a>.</p>
<p>A bi-colour LED is a single LED package with two LEDs inside, installed 
in a loop.&nbsp; The component will have two legs, and will have a clear or 
frosted lens (plastic bit).</p>

<p>If current flows in one direction, one LED will light.&nbsp; If the current 
is reversed, the other LED will light.&nbsp; If no current flows, then obviously 
no LEDs will light.&nbsp; Both LEDs cannot be lit at the same time.&nbsp; The 
HID device will represent this LED as an output with 3 states - 0=off, 1=LED1 
on, 2=LED3 on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bi-colour LED can be connected to any I/O 
port.</p>
<p>The datasheet for this type of LED should have values for V<sub>F</sub> and I<sub>F</sub> for both 
LEDs.&nbsp; The <a href="leds.htm#clr">current limiting resistor</a> is shared 
between the two LEDs, so a value must be chosen not to exceed the limit on 
either LEDs.&nbsp; The bi-colour 
LED is connected to two microcontroller pins.&nbsp; Don't forget the current 
limiting resistor.</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>Components can be given an optional name.&nbsp; This is seen in the Test tab.  Not all applications support the name.&nbsp; 
Hidcomp/hidconfig supports names.</p>

<h3 id="Usage">UsagePage/Usage</h3>
<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the LED.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p> Defines the amount of electrical current used by the LED in mA.  This is used to estimate the USB power draw.&nbsp; 
See the section on <a href="hardware.htm#current">Power</a> for more information.</p>

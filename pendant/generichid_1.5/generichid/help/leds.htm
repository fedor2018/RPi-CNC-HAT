<h1>LEDs</h1>
<h2>LEDs 101</h2>
<p>A Diode is an electronic component that allows current to flow in only one 
direction.&nbsp; An LED, or Light Emitting Diodes, is a diode that illuminates 
when sufficient voltage and current is supplied.&nbsp; They are polarised 
components meaning they have a right and wrong way of being connected.</p>
<p>The schematic symbol of an LED is shown below.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="ledsch.png" width="90" height="59"></p>
<p>The horizontal line is the wire.&nbsp; The triangle and vertical line combine 
to form the standard symbol of a diode.&nbsp; The two arrows indicate this diode 
is an LED.&nbsp; The triangle and vertical line indicate the flow of the 
current.&nbsp; The vertical line indicates a &quot;wall&quot; that the current can't flow 
back through.&nbsp; <b>A</b> is the anode, and is where the current flows in.&nbsp;
<b>K</b> is the cathode, where the current flows out.&nbsp; These names come 
from the days of vacuum tubes. </p>
<p>To illuminate the LED correctly, a voltage and sufficient current must be 
applied to the diode.&nbsp; The datasheet of an LED will give some important 
parameters...</p>

<h2 id="clr">Current Limiting Resistor</h2>
<p>If an LED was connected directly to a voltage source, we would end up with 
the following schematic of the circuit.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="ledsch2.png" width="86" height="162"></p>
<p>In this circuit, we ignore the resistor (the squiggly line), that is, it's 
resistance is zero.&nbsp; We can use Ohms V=IR, law to make an equation representing 
the circuit...</p>
<p>V<sub>total</sub> = V<sub>F</sub> + R.I</p>
<p>[The total voltage is the sum of the voltage drops.&nbsp; Also, the current 
is the same through each component]</p>
<p>We know the total voltage, V<sub>total</sub>=5 volts.&nbsp; We know the 
voltage drop across the LED, V<sub>F</sub>=2 volts (from the data sheet), and we 
know the resistance of our resistor in the circuit R=0 Ohms.&nbsp; Therefore,</p>
<p>5 = 2 + 0.I</p>
<p>or</p>

<p>The two divided by zero, gives the current, I, as infinite, or at least very 
large, because there are small resistances in the wires and the power source.&nbsp; 
What this example is trying to show is that you can't just connect an LED to a 
power source without some way of controlling the current flow.</p>

<p>By using the first equation, and the Forward Voltage and Forward Current from 
the LED datasheets, we can calculate the value of resistor we need to limit the 
current in the circuit.</p>

<p>If V<sub>F</sub>=2, and I<sub>F</sub>=20mA, or 0.020A, we have...</p>

<p>A 150 Ohm resistor will give a 20mA current.&nbsp; Note that for most LEDs, 
20mA is incredibly bright.&nbsp; For panel indicators, a small I<sub>F</sub> of 5mA or less will usually suffice. 
Also, electronics isn't terribly fussy with parameter value selection.&nbsp; If 
you don't have a 150 ohm resistor handy, the next higher value should be fine.</p>
<h2>Maximum Current</h2>
<p>According to the Atmel datasheets, the maximum current supplied or sunk by any 
individual pin is 40mA.&nbsp; The total current drawn from port combinations 
must not be exceeded.&nbsp; These limits are shown in the following table.</p>
<table>

<p>
The total current limit for the microcontroller is 200mA.</p>

<p>However, to ensure a long life, it is recommended that there values are never 
approached.&nbsp; LEDs can normally be illuminated on very small currents, 
usually in 1-2mA range.&nbsp; A simple test circuit, or a cheap LED tester will 
help select a suitable current.&nbsp; Remember, these LEDs are only going to be 
used as indicators, not room lighting.</p>

<h1>PWM - Pulse Width Modulation</h1>
<p>The PWM control is used to generate a PWM output signal on an output port.&nbsp; 
A PWM signal is a pulse that repeats at a fixed frequency.&nbsp; The width of 
the pulse can be varied from 0 to 100%.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pwmsignal.png" width="334" height="122"></p>
<p>The image above shows the PWM signal, plotting the output voltage against 
time.&nbsp; The period specifies the time the pulse repeats.&nbsp; The frequency 
of the signal is 1 / period, where the period is in seconds.&nbsp; In the 
example above, the pulse width, or duty cycle, is about 66%.</p>
<p>The frequency of the PWM signal and the resolution of the pulse width are 
defined as characteristics of the microcontroller.&nbsp; See the section on
<a href="timers.htm">timers</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The frequency of the PWM signal can be configured to be anything from 0.1Hz 
to 4MHz.&nbsp; For controlling LED brightness anything above 1kHz is fine.</p>
<p>So what is a PWM signal used for?&nbsp; In a HID device, they can be used for 
driving LEDs and other external loads.&nbsp; Hooking up an <a href="rgbled.htm">
RGB LED</a> to 3 PWM outputs will give infinite colour control of the LED.&nbsp; 
The PWM signal can also be used to adjust the brightness of an <a href="lcd.htm">
LCD</a> backlight.&nbsp; Beware of the current limitations of the 
microcontroller - it is not powerful enough to drive the LCD backlight directly.&nbsp; 
A switching circuit using a transistor of FET should be used.&nbsp; For 
example...</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pwmswitch.png" width="473" height="254"></p>
<p>A suitable NPN transistor or N-Channel FET should be chosen that can handle 
the current requirements.&nbsp; Transistors are recommended because they are 
less susceptible to static electricity damage.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A PWM component must be connected to a PWM compatible pin, one of: PB5, PB6, 
PB7, PB4, PD1, PC6,&nbsp; PC5 or PC4.</p>

<h3 id="Frequency">Frequency</h3>
<p>The frequency of the PWM output.  This is defined in the microcontroller timer setting, shown here for convenience.</p>

<h3 id="Resolution">Resolution</h3>
<p>The number of integer subdivisions the PWM period is divided into. This is defined in the microcontroller timer setting, shown here for convenience.</p>

<h3 id="Timer">Timer</h3>
<p>Which microcontroller timer this output is connected to.  This is dependent on the pin that the 
PWM output is connected to.</p>

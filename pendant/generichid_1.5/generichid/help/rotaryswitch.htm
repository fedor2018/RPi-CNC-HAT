<h1>Rotary Switch</h1>
<p>The rotary switch, or rotary selector switch, is used to select one of 
several options.&nbsp; The switches are usually mechanical so pull-up resistors 
and debouncing needs to be used.&nbsp; See <a href="mechanicalswitches.htm">
Mechanical Switches</a> for more information.</p>

<p>As shown in the schematic above, each output of a rotary switch needs its own 
pin.&nbsp; If the rotary switch has many outputs, consider using a
<a href="codedrotaryswitch.htm">Coded Rotary Switch</a>.</p>
<p>The rotary switch will appear on the HID device as an input with values that 
range from 0 to outputs - 1.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>Components can be given an optional name.&nbsp; This is seen in the Test tab.  Not all applications support the name.&nbsp; 
Hidcomp/hidconfig supports names.</p>

<h3 id="Usage">UsagePage/Usage</h3>
<p>The UsagePage and Usage of the Rotary Switch.  See <a href="usages.htm">Usages</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Outputs">Outputs</h3>
<p>The number of outputs on the selector switch.&nbsp; Note that the display of 
the rotary switch isn't updated when the number of outputs is changed.&nbsp; 
There is also a limit of 12 outputs.&nbsp; If you need more than 12 outputs, 
you'll need to define the device via an <a href="mcd.htm">.mcd file</a></p>

<h3 id="Pullup">Pull-up</h3>
<p>Selecting this enables the internal pull-up resistor of the microcontroller.  
This is the normally setting.  See 
<a href="mechanicalswitches.htm">Mechanical Switches</a> for more information.</p>
<p></p>

<h3 id="DebounceMs">Debounce (ms)</h3>
<p>Waits for the mechanical switch stop bouncing before registering a switch closure.&nbsp; Enter the time to wait in milliseconds.

See 
<a href="mechanicalswitches.htm">Mechanical Switches</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="Current">Current</h3>
<p> Defines the amount of electrical current used by the rotary switch in mA.  This is used to estimate the USB power draw.&nbsp; 
See the section on <a href="power.htm">Power</a> for more information.</p>

<p> Current drawn by switches is usually insignificant and can be set to 0.</p>

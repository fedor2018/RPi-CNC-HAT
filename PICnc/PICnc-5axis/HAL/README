The PICnc driver requires some setup based on your firmware options.

In /HAL/picnc-5a.h edit the following line:
"#define NUMAXES"

and make sure it matches the value of "#define MAXGEN" in /firmware/hardware.h

If these missmatch bad things will happen and you may get SPI errors. 

To compile the code and install it in machinekit linuxcnc use the following:
sudo comp --install picnc-5a.c


in your machine .hal file there are two loadtime options

"loadrt picnc pwmfreq=35000 stepwidth=1"

Above are the defaults 

The first is the pwm base frequency in Hz. Note the higher the frequecy the lower the resolution of the PWM output. 
The second is the min stepwidth pulse in 25ns steps.



[TODO add example ini and hal files]

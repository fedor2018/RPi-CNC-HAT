This subdirectory contains everything needed to build the PIC32 firmware image.

Main user configurable changes are limited to hardware.h under "user configuration defs". See that section of the file for more information.

Note if you just want to program a card as is you can skip this setup and just use one of the precompiled images:
PICnc-5axis.hex => Axis X, Y, Z, A, B enabled
PICnc-4axis.hex => Axis X, Y, Z, A enabled (unused axis as two GPIO outputs each)
PICnc-3axis.hex => Axis X, Y enabled (unused axis as two GPIO outputs each)


-- Programing enviroment OS: Windows --

Programing is currenlty done with a PICKIT3 (http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=PG164130) hardware and MPLAB software (http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/home.html). 

Hardware setup:
Plug the PICKIT3 into a USB port and CN2 (6 pin SIP header) on the PICnc 5 Axis board. 

Software setup:
Install MPLAB per Microchips instructions.

<todo add rest of programing instructions here>
